# Project Name: EYIA-Beta-
EYIA (Enterprise for Youth in Agriculture) is a three (3) months project at Soilless Farm Lab aimed to train unemployed youths and women in vegetable production (Olericulture) using technology. The technologies to be deployed include:
  + Greenhouse farming – this is a climate smart growing method that gives the growers control over biotic and abiotic     factors.
  + Soilless farming (hydroponics) – a growing method that does not depend on soil, it allows the grower to grow year       round regardless of season
  + ML & AI tools – These will be used in monitoring the irrigation of the plants as well as proper nutrient               combination for the plants
  + Integrated Pest management – A combination of physical and biological control will be used throughout the project       to ensure proper pest management.
The EYIA project is citated in Ogun State, Nigeria and runs through partnership with Mastercard foundation.
EYIA Beta was a special name for Cohort 2 patners of the project.

## Activities
We had patners from all over the six (6) geopolitical zones in Nigeria. A cluster (group of 50 students) in twenty (20) groups will be working on 4 plots of hydroponics farm set up, guided by twenty (20) different facilitators, with access to logistics and a storage facility on the farm. Each cluster will be registered as a company. Activities during the project didnt just include the trainings relating to Soilless farming, other fun activities which includes:
  * Peagantry 
  * Cooking competition
  * Sport and Games
  * Aerobics exercises were included.

## Data Collection
On the ninth week of the project, a google form (for project evaluation)was sent out to all patners via mail with responses in no time.
